# MERN Vite Fullstack - Orb Game

## Description

Fullstack multiplayer web application built with a React + Vite frontend and a Node.js/Express backend connected to MongoDB. It supports secure authentication (JWT), real-time gameplay with Socket.IO, and persistent player stats across sessions. The world updates continuously, allowing multiple users to play together in the same arena with smooth, low-latency communication.

Enhanced **orb interactions** and **user feedback systems**. In addition to standard collectible orbs, players encounter rare event-based elements such as speed boosters and lucky bonus orbs that alter movement and scoring dynamics. These are tracked persistently in each user’s profile, contributing to lifetime stats and global leaderboards. Real-time pop-up notifications, on-screen HUD chips, and live chat make the world active and responsive. The overall design focuses on an endless, replayable experience that rewards awareness, timing, and steady improvement rather than isolated rounds.
