# MERN Vite Full-stack Game

## Description

Full-stack web app built with a React + Vite frontend and a Node.js/Express backend connected to MongoDB. It includes secure user signup and login, real-time communication through Socket.IO, and a multiplayer endless game loop that allows many users to play together at once.

The backend handles authentication (JWT), user data storage, and game state management. The frontend provides a clean interface where users can register, log in, and jump straight into the game. The game itself is designed to be timeless and replayable—simple mechanics that stay engaging over repeated sessions.
